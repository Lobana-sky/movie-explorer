## Instructions
1.  FORK AND CLONE THIS REPO!!
2.  Create a new branch for your changes
3.  Implement the search functionality
    Steps?
4.  Once you get it working, refactor your App.js code:
    -- Create a constructURL method that will work both for the initial fetch and for fetching the search results
    -- Create a fetchMovies method that will work for both the initial render and for rendering the search results. Think about: where will this method be called?
5.  SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST to the dev branch when you’re done

If you finish early, work on your movie page:

-- Be sure it includes an image, some details about the movie, and the FIRST FOUR cast members, with pictures; other elements are optional
-- To view your movie page while you're working on it, you can comment out the MovieList component in App.js and render Movie instead
-- BONUS: Include an element in the interface that users can click to view all cast members

On Saturday we will look at a couple different ways to implement the Movie page (conditional rendering and React Routes) and get it hooked up.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
